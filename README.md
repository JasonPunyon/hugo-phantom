# Hugo Phantom Themes

This is a Hugo theme based on the [Phantom Theme by HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/phantom).

I created this theme, actually it's my first Hugo theme, for my [blog](http://www.hasecke.eu).

I provided an example site to show how to use the theme.

There is basic i18n support in this theme.

Look at `exampleSite/data/i18n.yaml`
